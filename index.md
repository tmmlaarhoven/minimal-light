## About Me

As the cryptographic community is preparing for a shift towards quantum-safe cryptography, to protect against future quantum attacks, many questions still need to be addressed: How can we design efficient "post-quantum" cryptography? How secure are these cryptographic schemes, theoretically and practically? And how should we ultimately choose parameters for these protocols, to balance performance and security?

My research focuses on lattice-based cryptography, the leading candidate for post-quantum cryptography, with an emphasis on understanding the true hardness of the underlying hard lattice problems. By improving state-of-the-art algorithms for solving these lattice problems, my research has directly impacted security estimates and parameter selection methods for lattice-based cryptography. Our study of the limitations of these algorithms has further inspired confidence in the security of these schemes when parameters are chosen accurately.

My research on lattice-based cryptography started during my doctoral studies at the Eindhoven University of Technology (2011-2016). After completing my PhD I continued this line of research at IBM Research in Switzerland (2016-2017), after which I returned to the Eindhoven University of Technology (2017-present). During Spring 2020 I was an invited visiting researcher at the UC Berkeley. My current position in Eindhoven is funded through a personal Veni Innovational Research Grant (EUR 250K) from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) for excellent young researchers.
